# Instruction Following Eval

This is an unofficial fork of [IFEval](https://github.com/josejg/google-research/tree/master/instruction_following_eval) (see [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07911)), designed to make running instruction following eval easier. The goals of the fork are as follows: 

- Make the codebase `pip` installable & fix the dependencies
- Provide runtime bindings that can be called from your own codebase. If you are interested in a CLI based interface see the original project.

### Install 

To install IFEval you

```shell
pip install ???
```

### Running IFEval
